* [x] improve performance by removing redundancy (service dependencies);
* [x] improve logging and debugging;
* [ ] more testing and compatiblity code for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSB;
* [+] improve RC compatibility: installability runscript services to /etc/init.d
      (easy to do), and adapt rs semantics to rc (LEVEL/ACTION... quite easy);
  [x] (partyly) done with runlevels command support (`sv-stage RUNLEVEL');
* [x] optimize parallel start/stop by using threads/pthread.h (*not easy*);
* [-] improve sv-shutdown compatibilty to SystemV or BSD shutdown/halt utilities;
