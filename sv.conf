# Enable nohang detection for service; service will recieve a SIGTERM after the
# timeout; SIGQUIT after a second timeout; and then SIGKILL. Default timeout is
# 60 seconds; service can change this setting by setting SVC_TIMEOUT or disable
# the timeout by setting SVC_KEYWORD=timeout (like checkfs).
#
# Alernatively, use SVC_NOHANG instead per service basis.

#
# Timeout in seconds to wait for pidfile (supervision services only).
#
# This is only limited to wait that a child process appeared as the process to
# be executed, so the timeout should not be too great because the start up of
# default runlevel will be much longer. When the pidfile scpecific to the process
# itself should be checked, a {stop,start}_post() shell function should be used
# instead with a specific timeout like:
#
#     start_post()
#     {
#     	svc_wait "${TIMEOUT}" "${PIDFILE}"
#     }
#
# See, apache service for paratical examples.

#
# Subsystem or envirionment the services are used for.
#
# If this package is used only to supervise daemons, set SV_SYSTEM="supervision";
# If used in docker container, set SV_SYSTEM="docker"; etc.
# This is not a *capabilty* because any supported subsystem can be used!
#
# This setting is rather used to isolate and start/stop only services
# relevant to a particular environment or subsystem.
#
# Valid subsystem keywords are: "docker", "jail", "lxc", "openvz", "prefix",
#   "supervision", "systemd-nspawn", "uml", "vserver", "xen0", "xenu".
#
# Jus set the `container=${CONTAINER}' environment to PID 1; or just setup the
# container to set up that environment variable--add `--env "container=docker"'
# to docker-run(1) and be done with it; then autodection will go fine for those
# subsystems. A XEN, VServer of Jailed environment should be detected with no
# additional steps.
#
#SV_SYSTEM="supervision"

#
# Prefix to use when SV_SYSTEM="prefix".
#
# The default prefix used is the one used for compilation passed to `--prefix'
# command line argument to the configure script. However, this prefix is not
# used to setup a prefix installation on Linux systems, only on BSD systems.
#
# Setting up a prefix service directory is rather simple: install the (compiled)
# package to a particular destination directory by using DESTDIR make variable;
# and then edit this file to set SV_PREFIX="${DESTDIR}" and SV_SYSTEM="prefix".
# And then remove the default services in runlevels (but miscfs:
#     `rm /etc/sv/.{sysboot,sysinit,single,shutdown,default}/*'
#
# If the subsystem is more like a virtual machine rather than a minimal container
# {miscfs,tmpfiles.setup} should be left is sysboot runlevel.
#
# Alternatively, this setting can be used for service look up in another
# directory; e.g. in BSD system such as FreeBSD, user services are installed in
# `/usr/local/etc/sv' instead of `/etc'. So, this add another service directory.
# Just do *not* forget to create the `.opt' symbolic link:
# `ln -s ${SV_LIBDIR} ${SV_PREFIX}${SV_SVCDIR}' -- the prefix environment should
# have a system configuration directory!
