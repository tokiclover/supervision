Header: supervision/ChangeLog, 2015/04/24

0.12.1:

Merged set/clean up shell functions for supervision and runscript services;
meaning that pre() is now named start_pre(), post() is now named stop_post();
log_pre() is renamed log_start_pre() and log_post() is now renamed log_stop_post().
And thus supervision services support a start_post() and stop_pre() shell
functions! So splitting services like udevadm to complement udev is now
superfluous and unnecessary. This noticeable change was necessary to ease
service creation and maintainability. So, the old supervision-functions API
was bumped to a new major number; the old pre() and post()... shell functions
are no longer supported.

0.12.0.1:

Miscellaneous fixes:

Moved CGroup bits to cgroup-functions and thus fix cgroup-release-agent path
for hardened kernels; and moved and duplicated device_info() shell function
to sv/{device-mapper,lvm,zfs} (broken with an OS_NAME conditional.)

Added early console font and keymap setup; and use a more sv/rdonlyfs.

SERVICE ADDITION:
SUPERVISION/SERVICES: dhcrelay;

0.12.0:

Added support to sysvinit compatible runlevels which is almost a stage
translation to {sysinit,boot,default,shutdown,reboot} and then...
{nonetwork,single} which required a few new stuff. See rs(8) for more
information.

0.12.0_rc4:

Optimized shutdown (stage-3) by removing yet other redundancies; now,
shutdown phase is as fast as boot up.

Added some usefull content to rs(8) manual page.

Miscellaneous fixes:

Optimize memory usage and alignment to avoid memory corruption with
{m,c,re}alloc(3) family syscalls in some use cases.

0.12.0_rc3:

Second major change (since 0.12.0_rc) is the removale of defining virtual
service by making symlinks. --This is oly used for service instances now.
Now, virtual service is done by defining SVC_PROVIDE for robustness.

Simplified greatly deptree generation by eliminating shell handling which
remove unnecessary complexity (300 lines removed) and improve performance
(4 shell executions). It's late for this... but it's greatly welcomed.

Sanitized shutdown phase (which had too many redundancy... some old code
was dormant in {rs,init-stage} which were entirely removed).

With the previous simplification, speed improved by 30% because parallel
start/stop became more optimal. And shutdown phase time is on par with
boot up with shutdown sanity clean up.

Miscellaneous fixes:

Dynamicaly allocate a deptree list, so that, init-sage stop will work as
usual (with new services scheduled in the right place);

0.12.0_rc2:

Schedule service start/stop for init-stage for {use,need} dependencies only
(performance improvements--{after,before} would be scheduled if present in
the init-stage). So, now, udevadm has to be manually added to stage-1 to get
a functionnal udev. --The time of lasy {after,before} scheduling is over.

Finshed SVC_OPTIONS refactorization by moving getty related bits to sv/getty
... and then renamed getty to getty-tty1 to avoid having no service entry in
SV_SVCDIR.

Miscellaneous fixes:
multiple `rs SERVICE add' was bogus;

0.12.0_rc:

Added another udev (udevadm runscript) service to populate dev in case udev is
used as a device manager; Added a safety OOM net in case of broken and cyclic
dependency definitions (stability fix); Fixed runtime environment setup (broken
with SVC_OPTIONS refactorization, so, unless SV_TERM was defined in the
configuration file, getty was getting only vt100 TERM environment variable.)

0.12.0_beta6:

Splited runscript service configuration files from sv/ to sv.conf.d/;
minor clean up and optimizations; important for broken 0.12.0_beta5
(init-stage was still using the old configuration file in sv/.opt/sv.conf).

0.12.0_beta5:

Moved main configuration file to SYSCONFDIR; added a safety for init-stage in
case daemontools(-encore) is used; important fix for broken 0.12.0_beta4.

0.12.0_beta4:

Install main manual page to section 5 to respect standard FHS;
Setup supervision environment only for supervision services;
Minors performance Improvements; minor fixes ({add,del} service
commands mainly); minor service fixes.

SERVICE ADDITION:
RUNSCRIPT/SERVICES: zfs-share;
SUPERVISION/SERVICES: cups-borwsed, zed;

0.12.0_beta3:

Merged {RS,SV}_SVCDIR (service directory) together for efficiency and clarity;
And thus, /sbin/rs lost the stage type command line argument (-r|--rs,-v|--sv).
There is no longer a /etc/rs.d or a (useless) /etc/service directories. Now,
look at sv/.stage-[0-3] directories for active services.

0.12.0_bata2:

Added missing configuration for runscript service (miscfs,clock,hostname);
Added alsasound runscript service;
miscellaneous minor fixes for dmcrypt.

0.12.0_beta:

Added since 0.12.0_alpha2:

Remove too many service start/stop redundency to improve performance (TODO);
tiny runscript services and init-stage tweaks to get the proper behavior.

0.12.0_alpha2:

Added since 0.12.0_alpha:

Fixed a nasty buffer overflow; and added better logging/debugging facility.

0.12.0_alpha:

Changed version numbering in favor of major.minor.revision;
Removed support for static /service/ (too difficult support);
(Removed ./RUN command support for supervision services);

Added init-system and services for init-system:
RUNSCRIPT/SERVICES: checkfs, clock, console, dmesg, hostname, kmod, dmcrypt,
kmod-static-nodes, localfs, mtab, networkfs, procfs, rootfs, swaps, swapfiles,
tmpfiles.{dev,setup}, lvm, raid, ipset, iptables, sysctl, device-mapper, zfs,
sysctl, pool;
SUPERVISION/SERVICES: xdm;

RENAMED SERVICES: squashdir to unionfs, tmpdir to tmpdirs, zram to zramfs;
SERVICE BEHAVIOR: install getty services using a virtual name instead to ease
service dependencies if need be; so, set the getty name or binary path in the
configuration file (default is agetty).

Version bumped sv-shutdown to be able to force reboot/shutdown in early boot
(for checkfs failure for example);
Version bumped /sbin/rs to better handle dependencies scheduling with a simple
scheduling algorithm which schedule services according to dependency; and take
care of dependencies handling instead of the internal shell environment;
Version bumped {fstab,mout}info to use almost the same code and to support '*'
cach all mountpoints;

Added a proper configure script for easy setup.
Added misc code and services to handle system initialization.

41:

Bug fixes of r40: properly mark service state after {stop,start}; stop
services properly if started only;

Improvements: added -q|--quiet to mountinfo; and added -E|--force to
sv-shutdown (to be able to write rs.d/checkfs service properly).

40:

Critical bug fix of r39 (bug introduced since r35): initialize static buffers
in file_test();

39:

Added C variant of mount_info() shell function (WARN: command line arguments
changed!) named simply mountinfo to get current mountpoints info; and
fstabinfo to get fstab(5) information with ease and simplicity.

Bug-fix of previous release (retun value of svc_{mark,state}()); removed
usage of getopt(1) for portability compliance.

38:

Bug-fix of r37: fix checkpath return value, and static /service/ installation.

37:

Added C conversion to sv/.lib/bin/{checkpath,sv-shutdown} for efficiency;
various minor bug fixes of r36 (notably, satisfy {after,before}
dependencies before {use,need} to attempt to get everything in
the right order.

Renamed sv/.lib/bin/{sp,sv-config} for clarity.

36:

r35 bug fixes:
install runscript with execute permission (critical fix);
mark service status properly (rs binary) by using the right return value.

Added optional sv/.lib/bin/initctl binary and sv/initctl service; for
SysVinit reboot/shutdocn compatibility. Add SYSVINIT=1 to make to get
everything.

35:

Added a new rs binary to manage properly service scheduling and start/stop
functionality after renaming sv/.lib/bin/rs to sv/.lib/sh/runscript.
WARN: New utility reverse the order of argument! (compared to the rs old
rs script).

Added a tiny utility to get terminal columns, so, printing utility can
format nicely output.

34:

Bug fix of r33 (use of command builtin instead of type builtin--zsh fix);
and init stage fix (handle `/var/SYMLINKS' to `/run').

33:

Bug fix of r32: extra service command support, tiny service lock. 
SERVICE/RUNSCRIPT: Added {dev,sys}fs

32:

Added runscript service support with a simple API which brings service
dependencies scheduling; supervision service is now scheduled with
{after,before,need,use} style dependencies.
Added praticable {boot,default,nonetwork,single} RUNLEVELS support.
Improved the manual with {BUILTINS,DEPENDENCIES,INIT-STAGE,RUNLEVELS}
sections; and numerous RUNSCRIPTS sub-sections.

Unified {supervision-backend,svc} scripts to sv/.bin/sp;
Unified Init-Stage-[123] into sv/.lib/sh/init-stage;
converted mdev-start-dev to runscript service.
Moved sv/.{bin,lib/bin} & library files from sv/.opt to sv/.lib/sh
to keep system configuration directory clean of extraneous files.

SERVICE/RUNSCRIPT: Added mdev, squashdir, tmpdir, zram
SERVICE/SUPERVISION: Added sulogin

31:

Added SCANCMD support to trigger re-scan (to get *hard* style dependencies
and a functional LSB start command.)

SERVICES: Moved lighttpd to virtual httpd/({busybox-,lig}http)
