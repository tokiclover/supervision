Header: supervision/ChangeLog, 2015/04/24

0.12.0_alpha:

Changed version numbering in favor of major.minor.revision;
Added init-system services:
RUNSCRIPT/SERVICES: checkfs, clock, console, dmesg, hostname, kmod, dmcrypt,
kmod-static-nodes, localfs, mtab, networkfs, procfs, rootfs, swaps, swapfiles,
tmpfiles.{de,setup}, lvm, raid;

RENAMED SERVICES: squashdir to unionfs, tmpdir to tmpdirs;
SERVICE BEHAVIOR: install getty services using a virtual name instead to ease
service dependencies if need be; so, set the getty name or binary path in the
configuration file (default is agetty).

Version bumped sv-shutdown to be able to force reboot/shutdown in early boot
(for checkfs failure for example);
Version bumped /sbin/rs to better handle dependencies scheduling;
Version bumped {fstab,mout}info to use almost the same code and to support '*'
cach all mountpoints;

41:

Bug fixes of r40: properly mark service state after {stop,start}; stop
services properly if started only;

Improvements: added -q|--quiet to mountinfo; and added -E|--force to
sv-shutdown (to be able to write rs.d/checkfs service properly).

40:

Critical bug fix of r39 (bug introduced since r35): initialize static buffers
in file_test();

39:

Added C variant of mount_info() shell function (WARN: command line arguments
changed!) named simply mountinfo to get current mountpoints info; and
fstabinfo to get fstab(5) information with ease and simplicity.

Bug-fix of previous release (retun value of svc_{mark,state}()); removed
usage of getopt(1) for portability compliance.

38:

Bug-fix of r37: fix checkpath return value, and static /service/ installation.

37:

Added C conversion to sv/.lib/bin/{checkpath,sv-shutdown} for efficiency;
various minor bug fixes of r36 (notably, satisfy {after,before}
dependencies before {use,need} to attempt to get everything in
the right order.

Renamed sv/.lib/bin/{sp,sv-config} for clarity.

36:

r35 bug fixes:
install runscript with execute permission (critical fix);
mark service status properly (rs binary) by using the right return value.

Added optional sv/.lib/bin/initctl binary and sv/initctl service; for
SysVinit reboot/shutdocn compatibility. Add SYSVINIT=1 to make to get
everything.

35:

Added a new rs binary to manage properly service scheduling and start/stop
functionality after renaming sv/.lib/bin/rs to sv/.lib/sh/runscript.
WARN: New utility reverse the order of argument! (compared to the rs old
rs script).

Added a tiny utility to get terminal columns, so, printing utility can
format nicely output.

34:

Bug fix of r33 (use of command builtin instead of type builtin--zsh fix);
and init stage fix (handle `/var/SYMLINKS' to `/run').

33:

Bug fix of r32: extra service command support, tiny service lock. 
SERVICE/RUNSCRIPT: Added {dev,sys}fs

32:

Added runscript service support with a simple API which brings service
dependencies scheduling; supervision service is now scheduled with
{after,before,need,use} style dependencies.
Added praticable {boot,default,nonetwork,single} RUNLEVELS support.
Improved the manual with {BUILTINS,DEPENDENCIES,INIT-STAGE,RUNLEVELS}
sections; and numerous RUNSCRIPTS sub-sections.

Unified {supervision-backend,svc} scripts to sv/.bin/sp;
Unified Init-Stage-[123] into sv/.lib/sh/init-stage;
converted mdev-start-dev to runscript service.
Moved sv/.{bin,lib/bin} & library files from sv/.opt to sv/.lib/sh
to keep system configuration directory clean of extraneous files.

SERVICE/RUNSCRIPT: Added mdev, squashdir, tmpdir, zram
SERVICE/SUPERVISION: Added sulogin

31:

Added SCANCMD support to trigger re-scan (to get *hard* style dependencies
and a functional LSB start command.)

SERVICES: Moved lighttpd to virtual httpd/({busybox-,lig}http)

30:

First release with {runit,s6}/Init-Stage-[123];
supervision.{conf,init}d init service & SERVICES.

SERVICES: acpid, cupsd, getty, inetd, udev, sshd, syslog,
atd, dbus, git-daemon, ntp, rsync-daemon, wpa_supplicant,
cgred, dhcp, gpm, pcscd, saned, cron, dns, hostapd, lighttpd, snmpd

VIRTUAL SERVICES: ntp/({busybox-,}ntpd), net/(dhcp/dhcp{,c}d...)
SERVICE INSTANCES: syslog/{rsyslog,socklog,syslog-ng}
SERVICE PROVIDERS:  cron/{d,f,vixie-}cron,cronie, inetd/{ipsvd,xinetd}
