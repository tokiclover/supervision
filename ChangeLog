Header: supervision-scripts/ChangeLog, 2015/03/30

32:

Added runscript service support with a simple API which brings service
dependencies scheduling; supervision service shutdown is now scheduled
with {after,before,need,use} style dependencies.
Improved the manual with {BUILTINS,DEPENDENCIES,INIT-STAGE} sections;
and numerous RUNSCRIPTS sub-sections.

Unified {supervision-backend,svc} scripts to sv/.opt/sv;
converted mdev-start-dev to runscript service.

SERVICE/RUNSCRIPT: Added mdev, squashdir, tmpdir, zram

31:

Added SCANCMD support to trigger re-scan (to get *hard* style dependencies
and a functional LSB start command.)
