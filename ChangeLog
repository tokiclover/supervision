Header: supervision/ChangeLog, 2015/04/24

37:

Added C conversion to sv/.lib/bin/checkpath for efficiency;
various minor bug fixes of r36 (notably, satisfy {after,before}
dependencies before {use,need} to attempt to get everything in
the right order.

Renamed sv/.lib/bin/{sp,sv-config} for clarity.

36:

r35 bug fixes:
install runscript with execute permission (critical fix);
mark service status properly (rs binary) by using the right return value.

Added optional sv/.lib/bin/initctl binary and sv/initctl service; for
SysVinit reboot/shutdocn compatibility. Add SYSVINIT=1 to make to get
everything.

35:

Added a new rs binary to manage properly service scheduling and start/stop
functionality after renaming sv/.lib/bin/rs to sv/.lib/sh/runscript.
WARN: New utility reverse the order of argument! (compared to the rs old
rs script).

Added a tiny utility to get terminal columns, so, printing utility can
format nicely output.

34:

Bug fix of r33 (use of command builtin instead of type builtin--zsh fix);
and init stage fix (handle `/var/SYMLINKS' to `/run').

33:

Bug fix of r32: extra service command support, tiny service lock. 
SERVICE/RUNSCRIPT: Added {dev,sys}fs

32:

Added runscript service support with a simple API which brings service
dependencies scheduling; supervision service is now scheduled with
{after,before,need,use} style dependencies.
Added praticable {boot,default,nonetwork,single} RUNLEVELS support.
Improved the manual with {BUILTINS,DEPENDENCIES,INIT-STAGE,RUNLEVELS}
sections; and numerous RUNSCRIPTS sub-sections.

Unified {supervision-backend,svc} scripts to sv/.bin/sp;
Unified Init-Stage-[123] into sv/.lib/sh/init-stage;
converted mdev-start-dev to runscript service.
Moved sv/.{bin,lib/bin} & library files from sv/.opt to sv/.lib/sh
to keep system configuration directory clean of extraneous files.

SERVICE/RUNSCRIPT: Added mdev, squashdir, tmpdir, zram
SERVICE/SUPERVISION: Added sulogin

31:

Added SCANCMD support to trigger re-scan (to get *hard* style dependencies
and a functional LSB start command.)

SERVICES: Moved lighttpd to virtual httpd/({busybox-,lig}http)
