Header: supervision/ChangeLog, 2015/04/24

32:

Added runscript service support with a simple API which brings service
dependencies scheduling; supervision service is now scheduled with
{after,before,need,use} style dependencies.
Added praticable {boot,default,nonetwork,single} RUNLEVELS support.
Improved the manual with {BUILTINS,DEPENDENCIES,INIT-STAGE,RUNLEVELS}
sections; and numerous RUNSCRIPTS sub-sections.

Unified {supervision-backend,svc} scripts to sv/.bin/sp;
Unified Init-Stage-[123] into sv/.lib/sh/init-stage;
converted mdev-start-dev to runscript service.
Moved sv/.{bin,lib/bin} & library files from sv/.opt to sv/.lib/sh
to keep system configuration directory clean of extraneous files.

SERVICE/RUNSCRIPT: Added mdev, squashdir, tmpdir, zram
SERVICE/SUPERVISION: Added sulogin

31:

Added SCANCMD support to trigger re-scan (to get *hard* style dependencies
and a functional LSB start command.)

SERVICES: Moved lighttpd to virtual httpd/({busybox-,lig}http)
