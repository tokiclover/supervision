# Set clock to 'UTC' (also known as Greenwich Mean Time or GMT for short)
# if the hardware is set up to UTC. Else, set clock to 'local' if the hardware
# clock is set to 'local'; e.g. Windows dual boot users shall set the clock to
# 'local'.

CLOCK="UTC"

# Enable this to set the system time from the current hardware time.
# Modern kernel with CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS=y does not need this if the hardware
# clock is set to 'UTC'.

# Enable this to set the hardware time from system current time when shutting

# Append extra argument to pass to hwclock. Alpha users may append --arc or
