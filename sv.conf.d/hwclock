# *** IMPORTANT NOTE: ***
#
# When using hardware time to synchronize system time, with a modern kernel
# (v3.9 or latter), the Linux kernel handle the synchronization internally.
# So, checkout if CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS is enabled; if so, remove the service
# from sysboot runlevel by issuing `sv-run --sysboot clock del'.
#
# If a ntp daemon is used to keep the system clock in synchronisation with
# a server, CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC should be enabled.
#
# See https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/System_time for more information.
#
# *** END OF THE NOTE ***
#
#
# Set clock to 'UTC' (also known as Greenwich Mean Time or GMT for short)
# if the hardware is set up to UTC. Else, set clock to 'local' if the hardware
# clock is set to 'local'; e.g. Windows dual boot users shall set the clock to
# 'local'.
#
CLOCK="UTC"

#
# Enable this to set the system time from the current hardware time.
# Modern kernel with CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS=y does not need this if the hardware
# clock is set to 'UTC'.
#
#CLOCK_HCTOSYS="Yes"

#
# Enable this to set the hardware time from system current time when shutting
# down the system
#
#CLOCK_SYSTOHC="Yes"
#
# Append extra argument to pass to hwclock. Alpha users may append --arc or
# --srm.
