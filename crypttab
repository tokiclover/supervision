# Configuration file for (dm-crypt) crypted devices
#
# Some options differ slightly, from the reference manual page, so everything
# should be up and running in no time. Otherwise, read the following for more
# info about the differnces.
#
# Format: <volume> <device> <password/keyfile> <options>
#
# <volume> being the mapping name to get the `/dev/mapper/<volume>' device.
#
# <device> support either file node /dev/sda1, UUID=<uuid> or LABEL=<label>
#   device specification.
#
# <keyfile> can be /dev/[u]random for swap devices, though it would be best
#   to have a static keyfile, e.g. `/etc/swaps_keyfile' generated regularly
#   with `openssl rand -base64 48 >/etc/swaps_keyfile' to avoid starving the
#   system at bootup (not enough entropy).
#
#   <password/keyfile> can be any of none|pwd|- to be prompted for a password;
#   `/path/to/file[:reg]' for a regular keyfile, `:reg' postfix being optional
#   for systemd compatibility, just like the improper use of `none' for password;
#   `/path/to/file:luks' for a LUKS crypted keyfile;
#   `/path/to/file:gpg' for GnuPG crypted keyfile.
#
#   FIXME: GnuPG support is not tested! v2.x would require a few hacks because of
#     the ncurses dependencies; v1.4.x would require only a console/term hack.
#
# <options> being a comma separated list of options in the following list:
#
# luks|plain|tcrypt|loopaes|swap
#   Enable a particular mode for the device. LUKS ecnrypted devices would be
#   LUKS decrypted if a LUKS header is found. {cipher,hash} modes apply only
#   for dm-crypt `plain' mode.
#
#   NOTE: `tcrypt' mode for TrueCrypt; see cryptsetup(8) for info on the modes;
#     and {keyfile-{offset,size},size} options does not apply.
#
#     When using `tcrypt', use `tcrypt-keyfile' option to specify multiple
#     keyfiles for multiway passphrase. And finaly use `/dev/null' in the third
#     field to specify an empty password.
#
#   NOTE: `swap' mode enforce dm-crypt plain mode; so nothing will be done if a
#     LUKS header is found.
#
#   NOTE: `loopaes' mode filter out keyfile-offset option;
#
#   WARN: swap devices would be destroyed at each bootup!
#
# remdev=LABEL=<label> (WARN: Extra option not supported by systemd)
#   Removable device to use to get the keyfile.
#
# discard
#   Pass through discard requests to underlying block device to improve
#   performence on SSD. WARN: security implications
#
# cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256
#   Cipher to use, see cryptsetup(8) for more info. A cipher with unpredicable
#   IV value, like the example, is recommended.
#
# hash=sha512
#   Hash to use, see cryptsetup(8) for more info. This can be passed with cipher
#   option.
#
# header=(UUID=<uuid>|LABEL=<label>|/path/to/file)
#   Use a detached header for LUKS cyphertext which can be a device or regular
#   file.
#
# offset=256
#   Offset for the backed device in 512 byte sectors, only relevant for 'plain'
#   devices; see cryptsetup(8) for more info.
#
# skip=128
#   How many 512-byte sectors of the ecnrypted data to skip at the beginning.
#   This is different from offset option in respect to vector (IV) calculation
#   or initialization. Using --offset will shift the IV calculation by the same
#   negative offset. While using --skip will cause the first mapped sector to be
#   the appended argument (to --skip).
# 
# keyfile-offset=2048
#   Number of bytes to skip at the start of the keyfile; see cryptsetup(8) for
#   more info.
#
# keyfile-size=128
#   Number of bytes to read from the keyfile; see cryptsetup(8) for possible
#   values.
#
# key-size=128 (WARN: mis-named `size' for systemd!)
#   Keysize in bits; see cryptsetup(8) for more info about valid values.
#
# key-slot=1
#   Key slot to use (default to the first found); see cryptsetup(8) for more
#   info.
#
# noauto (IGNORED)
#   Skip device at bootup.
#
# nofail
#   Do not fail bootup if this device cannot be decrypted.
#
# readonly (`read-only' is NOT SUPPORTED)
#
# tcrypt-hidden
#   Use a hidden TrueCrypt volume (requires `tcrypt' option).
#
# tcrypt-keyfile=/etc/tcrypt_keyfile
#   Keyfile for TrueCrypt which can specified several times for multiway
#   passphrase. Only one line is read from keyfile excluding the new line
#   character. All keyfile should be available; using a removable device
#   is an option to get everything to decrypt the device.
#
# tcrypt-system
#   Use tcrypt in system encryption mode.
#
# timeout=128 (seconds by default, or append `ms' for milliseconds, `min' for
#   minute and `h' for hour)
#   Specify the time to use for decryption.
#
# tmp (NOT SUPPORTED, an entry to fstab(5) should suffice)
#
# tries=3
#   Specify the number of tries (default to 3).
#
# verify (IGNORED)
#   Verify the password, meaning typing twice.
