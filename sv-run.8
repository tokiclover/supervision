.SH NAME
sv-run \- manage runscript and supervision services
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sv-run
is a utility to manage runscript and supervision services.
This utility is used in conjunction with a supervsor like
.B runit
,
.B s6
or
.B daemontools[\-encore]
to get a fully supervised init-system and service-manager.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sv-run
.RB [\| OPTIONS \| ]
.RB \| SERVICE \|
.RB \| COMMAND \|
.RB [\| ARGUMENTS \|]

.B sv-run
.RB [\| \-h|\-\-help \|]
.RB [\| \-v|\-\-version \|]

.B SERVICE
name can be replaced by
.B scan
to update the dependency cache of services passed as arguments
like \fBsv-run scan \fIspawn-fcgi.{lighttpd,nginx}\fR.

.B SERVICE
name can be replaced by the special use case
.B init
to manage a whole bundle of services instead of a single service; for example,
`sv-run --default init' to bring the system to default runlevel.
This usage is now superseded by
.B sv-rc
utility, see
.BR sv-rc (8)
manual page; and is thus discouraged.

.B NOTE:
If
.B service
is not installed in the default path, either add
.B @LIBDIR@/bin:@LIBDIR@/sbin
to
.B PATH
environment variable; or else, copy the symlink to
.I @EXEC_PREFIX@/sbin
for example to get the same behaviour; or else use
.B sv-run
instead because
.B service
is a just limited interfaces to manage service.

Do note that it's rather prefered and recommended to use
.B sv-run
command to manage services rather than using the service executable. And this
is more true for supervision services when dealing with dependencies and
virtual services. Starting a supervision service shall be done with
.B sv-run
binary instead of using
.B @SYSCONFDIR@/sv/SERVICE/run

.SH "SERVICE COMMANDS"
Standard commands along with extra service commands are supported.
.B start
Start a service if down or stopped (supervision service wait up to 10 seconds
by default to start a service.)
.TP
.B stop
Stop a service if up or started (supervision service wait up to 10 seconds by
default to stop a service.)
.TP
.B restart
Restart a service after stopping it if started (runscript service can define
a particular shell function for this purpose.)
.TP
.B remove
Remove a supervised service from the running directory.
This command has no effect for runscript services.
.TP
.B status
Report the status of service (if started or stopped.)
.TP
.B zap
Remove the temporary files of a service to be able to start a fresh environment,
or restart a service if already started.
.TP
.B add
Add a service to an init-stage or runlevel (run level argument is required.)
.TP
.B del
Remove a service from an sv-init.sh or runlevel (stage level argument is required.)
.TP
.B cgroup_remove_service
Remove the Control Group
hierarchy after stopping a service. This command has no effect for runscript
services if not used with a daemon.
.B CGROUP_CLEANUP=ENABLE
environmenet variable can be enabled for automatic clean up.
.TP
.B new
add a new supervised service from a template. This command should be run with
`\fI@LIBDIR@/sv/bin/sv-config [--log] \fBSERVICE \fInew\fR'.
.TP
.B extra-commands
Extra comands defined as shell functions and added to
.B SVC_COMMANDS
(command that can be executed with any service status) or
.B SVC_STARTED_COMMANDS
(for any command that shooukd be executed in started service status) or
.B SVC_STOPPED_COMMANDS
(for command that should be executed in stopped service status)
environment variable. Any defined command can be used like a standard service command.
.TP
.B desc
.RB [\| COMMAND \|]

Print service description to standard output.
.B COMMAND
argument can be passed to print the description of the named command instead of the
description of the service, `sv-run udev desc reload' for example.
.TP
.B scan
Update the dependency cache of a service. \fIsv-run scan \fBSERVICES\fR can be used
for a list of service instead.
.TP
.B down
Send down command to the supervisor (supervision only)
.TP
.B up
Send up command to the supervisor (supervision only)
.SH CONFIGURATION
See
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/sv.conf
for the global configuration file; or
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/sv.conf.d/\fBSERVICE\fR
for runscript service configuration file; or
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/sv/\fBSERVICE\fI/OPTIONS\fR[\fB.INSTANCE\fR]
for supervision service configuration file; or else,
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/sv.conf.local.d/\fBSERVICE\fR

See
.BR supervsion (5)

.B sv-run
service management.

.TP

.TP
.B 9

.I status

.TP
.B 10
for
.I status
service command when a service is waiting for the lockfile
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Some services are added to the service directory? Try starting them then.
It seems to work? Good, try to add them in an init runlevel with
`\fIsv-run \fB--RUNLEVEL SERVICE \fIadd\fR'; and then regenerate the priority file
by running `\fIsv-rc \fBRUNLEVEL\fR' and then checkout
\fI@RUNDIR@/sv/.tmp/deps/\fBRUNLEVEL\fR to see if the service is inserted
in the right place depending on the dependency definitions. Or better,
check out the file beforehand. It looks weird or the order changed dramatically?
Try removing the file altogether and try again after issuing `\fIsv-run \fBSERVICE \fIscan\fR'
to update the dependency cache. Else, it can be a case of cyclic
dependency definition. Major dependency redefinition is necessary.

.B NOTE:
Cyclical dependency definitions will cause dependency setup to fail when using
`\fIsv-run \fBSERVICE \fIstart\fR'
or service scheduling havoc in dependency tree files mentionned above.
